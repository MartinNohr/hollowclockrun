This is an improved version of the code for the Hollow Clock V (found in thingiverse.com).
1. Uses the micro second counter for improved accuracy adjustment.
2. Fixes the time slippage that the original code had every 47? days when the millisecond counter overflowed.
3. Added a TTY menu system to make various adjustments to the clock.
See the docx file for complete details.
